## Introduction

KEP 9997 introduces the `?.` none conditional check operator, reduces the code writing of KCL list/dict/schema variables to determine whether the variable is `None` when taking its member elements, and simplifies configuration.

## Semantics

Basic usage: If the object is `None`/`Undefined` or empty (empty list [] or empty dictionary {}), the subsequent operation of obtaining members is not performed, and None is returned directly.

* `?.NAME` indicates that when a schema/dict variable is not `None` or empty, the sub-property whose name is `NAME` is taken, otherwise it returns `None`.
* `?[index]` indicates that when a list is not None or Empty, the sub-property whose index index is index is taken, otherwise it returns `None`.
* `?.NAME()` indicates that when a string variable is not `None` or empty, the member function `NAME` is called, otherwise it returns `None`.

## Examples

* `?.NAME`

```python
schema Person:
    name: str

person = Person {name = "Alice"}
data = {}
name1 = person?.name  # "Alice"
name2 = data?.name  # None
```

* `?[index]`

```python
emptyList = []
fullList = [1, 2, 3]
data1 = emptyList?[0]  # None
data2 = fullList?[1]  # 2
```

* `?.NAME()`

```python
schema Person:
    name: str

person = Person {name = "Alice"}
data = {}
name1 = person?.name  # "Alice"
name2 = data?.name  # None
name3 = name1?.lower() or "bob"  # "alice"
name4 = name2?.lower() or "bob"  # "bob"
```
