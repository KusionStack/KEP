## Introduction

KEP-9999 introduced the union operator `|` that supports built-in list, dict and schema of collection types.

## Overview

By introducing the union operator `|` that supports collection types, developers can obtain the following writing benefits:

* Replace KCL's original inelegant non-in-place dict merging method `c = {**a, **b}` to `c = a | b`, simplifying the code.

## Semantics

Specifically, the union of the collection type is mainly used in the following four ways:

* `list | list -> list`: According to the index correspondence, the list variable/expression on the right side of the `|` operator is merged to the variable/expression on the left side of the operator, and a new list variable is returned. An error occurs when the list lengths are not equal.
* `dict | dict -> dict`: According to the dict key, merge all key-value pairs in the dict variable/expression on the right side of the `|` operator into the dict variable/expression on the left side of the operator, and return a new dict variable.
* `schema | dict -> schema`: According to dict key-value, merge all key-value pairs in the dict variable/expression on the right side of the `|` operator into the schema variable/expression on the left side of the operator, and return a new schema variable.
* `schema | schema -> schema`: According to the schema key-value, merge all key-value pairs in the schema variable/expression on the right side of the `|` operator into the schema variable/expression on the left side of the operator, and return a new the schema variable.

## Examples

* `list | list`

```python
a = [{key1 = "value1"}]
b = [{key2 = "value2"}]
c = a | b  # c = [{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}]
```

* `dict | dict`

```python
a = {key1 = "value1"}
b = {key2 = "value2"}
c = a | b  # c = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
```

* `schema | dict`

```python
schema Person:
    name: str = "Alice"
    age: int = 18

person1 = Person {}  # person1 = {"name": "Alice", "age": 18}
person2 = person1 | {name = "Bob"}  # person2 = {"name": "Bob", "age": 18}
```

* `schema | schema`

```python
schema Person:
    name: str = "Alice"
    age: int = 18

person1 = Person {}  # person1 = {"name": "Alice", "age": 18}
person2 = person1 | Person {name = "Bob"}  # person2 = {"name": "Bob", "age": 18}
```
