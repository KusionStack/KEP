## What is KEP

KEP stands for KCL Enhancement Proposal, which aims to help KCL better iteratively evolve. The content of KEP can generally be new features of KCL, enhancement or simplification of existing syntax and semantics, etc. We want KEP to be the primary mechanism for coming up with major new features and gathering community input on an issue.

## KEP Workflow

The standard KEP workflow is:

- Fork the `KEP repository`, and create a file named `KEP-9999.md` that contains the new KEP. Use "9999" as the draft KEP number.
- Write your KEP following the [KEP Formats](#kep-formats).
- Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.
- Once approved, we will assign your KEP a number.

## KEP Formats

Each KEP must begin with an style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order.

```md
| KEP: |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Title: |  |
| Author: |  |
| Status: |  |
| Type: | Markdown |
| Created: |  |
| Post-History: |  |
```

The following content is generally not limited. It is best to describe the motivation and content of the KEP in the first introduction section, followed by a detailed expansion of the content (preferably with a complete KCL code example) and possible negative points, and finally describe the conclusion of the KEP.
