## Introduction

KEP 9996 introduces the schema optional attribute operator `?`, which can divide schema attributes into optional attributes and required attributes. The benefit is to reduce the code for writing `None` value judgments in the schema and the amount of code for checking to judge `None` values.

## Semantics

* Basic usage: When a schema attribute NAME is modified with the `?` symbol, it means that the value of the corresponding NAME attribute of the schema instance can be `None` or `Undefined`. When a schema attribute is not modified with the ? symbol, it means that the schema attribute cannot be `None` or `Undefined`, otherwise Report an error. Note that the default value of the schema attribute that is not modified by `?` can be `None` or `Undefined`, but the value of the attribute needs to be passed in when the schema is instantiated.
* Instructions for inheritance contraction of optional attributes:
  * When the attribute of a schema is optional, the attribute of the same name of the subclass schema can be set to mandatory and optional.
  * When the attribute of a schema is mandatory, the attribute with the same name of the subclass schema can only be set to mandatory.

## Examples

```python
schema Person:
    name: str  # required attribute
    age?: int  # option attribute

        
person1 = Person {
    name = "Alice"
}
person2 = Person {}  # Error: attribute name of Person is required and can't be None
```

* Example of code changes before and after the introduction of the `?` operator:

  * Before

```python
schema Person:
    name: str = option("name")
    age: int
    labels: {str:}
        
    check:
        name
        age and age >= 0
```

  * After

```python
schema Person:
    name: str = option("name")
    age: int
    labels?: {str:}
        
    check:
        age >= 0
```

* Examples of a schema-inherited optional attribute.

```python
schema Base:
    attr1?: int
    attr2: int

schema Sub(Base):
    attr1: int  # Right, optional attribute to required attribute
```

```python
schema Base:
    attr1?: int
    attr2: int

schema Sub(Base):
    attr2?: int  # Error, required attribute to optional attribute
```
